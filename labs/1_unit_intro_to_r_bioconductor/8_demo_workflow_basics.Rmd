## R is frustrating!!

 - Frustration is natural when you start programming in R
 - Take comfort in that it's both typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and 
 - The only way to get over it is to keep trying.

Before we go any further, let's make sure you've got a solid foundation in running R code, and that you know about some of the most helpful RStudio features.

## File types

 - Console (does not get stored) 
 - R-script (reproducible, needs comments `##`)
 - R-markdown (works with 
 
 ` ```{r} `
 
 code
 
 ## comment
 
 ` ``` ` 
 
 - R-presentations (Rmd special render)
 - Text (plain text)

## Coding basics

You can use R as a calculator:

```{r}
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sqrt(pi / 2)
```

## Assigning to a variable

You can create new objects with `<-`:

```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
```

## Assigning value to a variable: "assign statement"

All R statements where you create objects, __assignment__ statements, have the same form:

```{r eval = FALSE}
object_name <- value

```

In some older scripts you will also see `=` as a variable assigning operator. The difference is that the variable assigned by `<-` will exist in every environment, whereas using `=` will result in a variable that can only be called from the environment that is was created in.

The operator <- can be used anywhere, whereas the operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt).

So always use `<-` when explicitely assigning a variable in R.

When reading that code say "object name gets value" in your head.

## What's in a name?

 - Object names must start with a letter
 - Can only contain letters, numbers, `_` and `.`. 
 - You want your object names to be descriptive, 
 - Naming conventions:
 
 I recommend __snake_case__ where you separate lowercase words with `_`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOuNCEconVentionS__altoGetheR
```

## Writing code
 - Write code for humans, not for computers!
 - Comment extensively, future you will be grateful
 - Do not repeat yourself (will be explained during "Functional programming")
 - Do only one thing at a time!
 
## Commenting code (example)
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=2}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
# setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(12345)
# function to generate random number in R
?runif
# create 450 random numbers
this_is_an_object <- runif(450)
# create second vector with 450 
# random numbers between 0 and 1*10^12
this_is_another_object <- runif(450, 0, 10^12)
# create a dataframe (tibble)
this_is_a_tibble <- as_tibble(cbind(this_is_an_object, 
                          this_is_another_object))
```

## Commenting plot code
We'll come back to code style later, in [functions].
```{r, fig.width=3.8, fig.height=1.5}
# create a ggplot scatter graph 
# with linear regression smoother
ggplot(data = this_is_a_tibble, 
  aes(x = this_is_an_object, 
      y = this_is_another_object)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Inspecting objects (variables)
You can inspect an object by typing its name:

```{r}
x
```

Make another assignment:

```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
this_is_shorter <- 3.0

```
Autocompletion makes it possible to select the proper variable. type "this" to try it out.

## Typos, Case etc.
Make yet another assignment:

```{r}
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

Let's try to inspect it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_rock
#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found
R_rocks
#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found
```

## R is very picky, and easily insulted

 - There's an implied contract between you and R: 
 - It will do the tedious computation for you, 
 - but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. 
 - Typos matter. 
 - *_Case maTTers!!_*

## Calling functions
R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:
```{r eval = FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

## An example function
 - Let's try using `seq()` which makes regular **seq**uences of numbers
 - Type `se` and hit TAB. A popup shows you possible completions. Specify `seq()` by using the arrows.  
 - Type a "q" to disambiguate, or by using `up`/`down` arrows to select. 
 - Notice the tooltip that pops up. 
 - Press F1 to get all the details in help tab in the lower right pane*. 

Press TAB. RStudio will add matching opening (`(`) and closing (`)`) parentheses for you. Type the arguments `1, 10` and hit return.

```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```

## Opening and closing ""
Type this code and notice similar assistance help with the paired quotation marks:

```{r}
x <- "hello world"
```

"...", (...), [...] and {...} must always come in a pair. RStudio does its best to help you, but it's still possible to mess up and end up with a mismatch. If this happens, R will show you the continuation character "+":

```
> x <- "hello
+
```

The `+` tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn't think you're done yet. Usually that means you've forgotten either a `"` or a `)`. Either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.

## Environment in RStudio
Now look at your environment in the upper right pane:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(root, "/screenshots/rstudio-env.png"))
```

Here you can see all of the objects that you've created.

## Exercise 1
1.  Why does this code not work?

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    my_variable <- 10
    my_varıable
    ```
    
    Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but
    training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off
    when programming.)
 
## Exercise 2    
2.  Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)

    ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    
    fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
    filter(diamond, carat > 3)
    
```    

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
